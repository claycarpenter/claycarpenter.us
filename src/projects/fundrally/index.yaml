        h4 Background

        p This was a sample project in my Bloc UX Design course. The assignment included developing a design for a fundraiser site along the lines of Kickstarter or IndieGoGo.

        h4 Business Analysis

        p While the assignment specified that the design was intended to be a community fundraiser site, it left the specifics undefined. I decided to fill in the details with my own concrete vision for the site. Once the site's vision was documented, I wrote collections of user stories to build a fine-grained defintion of what would need to be designed and built to see that vision realized.

        h4 Design

        p The final design was inspired by Google's Material Design, as well as InVision's excellent style. Dark charcoal gray headers sit atop white content areas. Navigation links are muted in the dark header, while the content pops in contrast. The site leans heavily on the dark gray and white monochrome scheme, but relies on pink and dark red to add accents and draw users' attention to specific areas and points of interactivity.
